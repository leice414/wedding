                <p>
                  Despite their self-proclaimed greatness, Jon and Leice have a cute first date story. They met standing beside the Bubble Tea station at the mall.
                  Jon was blown away by Leice's crazy energy and thirst for adventure.
                  Leice thought Jon was alright looking and a pretty damn good guitarist.
                  It did take months, but somehow he managed to woo her into considering him as a partner, and the rest is history.

              <h2>Port Douglas &amp; surrounds</h2>
              <p>Port Douglas is a town on the Coral Sea in the tropical far north of Queensland, Australia.</p>
              <p>Port Douglas, affectionately known as “Port”, is a sophisticated but laid back seaside village just 67 kilometres north of Cairns International Airport along the Captain Cook Highway. The closest town to the Great Barrier Reef with no traffic lights or parking meters in sight, Port Douglas is the perfect place to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life whilst still enjoying cosmopolitan and contemporary style in a tropical climate.</p>
              <p>
                It's known for its beach resorts and as a base for visits to both the Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest reef system, and Daintree National Park, home to biodiverse rainforest.
              </p>
              <p>In town, Macrossan Street is lined with boutique shops and restaurants. Curving south is popular Four Mile Beach.</p>

              <p>Cruise the Great Barrier Reef Drive. Stretching from Palm Cove to Cape Tribulation, the bitumen winds through rainforest, mountain, coast offering glimpses of the famed reef.</p>
              <p>Leaving Cairns behind, head north past the northern beaches of Clifton beach, Trinity beach and Palm Cove. With its long sandy beach lapped by the Coral Sea and a backdrop of rainforest-clad mountains, Palm Cove has the perfect setting for an intimate getaway.
              </p>
              <p>Driving north you pass through pretty Ellis Beach before the road hugs the coastline as it winds between rainforest clad mountains and the waters of the Great Barrier Reef. Stop at a deserted beach along the way and linger at the Rex Lookout where an incredible 180-degree view of the Coral Sea and its coastline begs a photograph. The road leaves the blue of the ocean for the green of sugar cane fields just before the palm-lined entrance to Port Douglas.</p>
              <p>Known as the place where A-list celebrities escape, Port Douglas has an incredible array of restaurants, great boutique shopping and the iconic Four Mile Beach. It is the closest mainland port to the Great Barrier Reef and only a short drive to the rainforest at Daintree and Cape Tribulation. Settle into your exclusive resort or spacious boutique apartment where everything is in close proximity.</p>
